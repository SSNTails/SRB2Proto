 INTRODUCTION
 ************

 Let me tell you something : Doomatic is a great utility!

 Before it, we were using DM, and we were playing the same ole boring map
 nearly all the time. Using PATCHES was a GREAT PAIN in the a#s.

 Worst : it was very difficult to convince other people to join our games
  because we had to copy the files and install the patches to everybody...

 !!!!  NOW DOOMATIC HAS ARRIVED AND ITS TOTALLY UTTERLY PURE HEAVEN  !!!!

 Now we are playing a lot of different maps, there's never more than five
 seconds between deathmatches (except for entering our comments into our
 demos!), and we use several EXE patches in a breeze.

 Even better : we can invite anyone to play with us, even if he/she doesnt
  have the wad files and patches. We just copy him the DOOMATIC.EXE, and
  he/she joins our game!

 Well, it should be pretty obvious by now :


		  DOOMATIC ...

		  IT's - M A G I C -

		  IT'S - A U T O M A T I C -

		  IT'S - W U N D E R B A R -

		  IT's - M E R V E I L L E U X -

		  IT's - F A N T A S T I C -

		  IT's ... DOOMATIC !


  ... but it's only for IPX network by now. We'll add TCP/IP support
  and/or modem support in the future if we receive enough feedback!


 INSTALLATION
 ************

 Just unpack the Doomatic archive into your DOOM2 directory.

 ( ! Doomatic must be run from the main directory of Doom2 )

 Skip to the 'QUICKSTART' section if you want to try Doomatic immediately.


 Quick file description:


  DOOMATIC.EXE	- the thing that we're talking about.

  DOOMATIC.CFG	- this is the default Doomatic configuration file. We have
		  provided a basic configuration file so that you can play
		  some maps of Doom2 very fast.

		  DOOMATIC will create a default configuration file if the
		  doomatic.cfg file is not found.


  LMPMAST.EXE	- I have written this program waaaaay before Doomatic,
		  because I like to keep demos, and I wanted to record
		  comments, names of the players and have some statistics
		  about my demos.

		  Now it's PURE HEAVEN since DOOMATIC simply calls LMPMAST
		  with the right options when you activate the 'record demos'
		  option of Doomatic.

		  If you have some demos in your Doom2 dir , try the
		  following:

		  LMPMAST /dir


 QUICK START
 ***********

 We have put a default configuration file with Doomatic, so that you can
 launch a game in two secs and see how cool it is!

 1. The 'master' (he chooses levels and set the options) needs DOOMATIC.EXE
    and DOOMATIC.CFG unpacked into Doom2 directory.

    The 'slaves' (who simply join the server) only need DOOMATIC.EXE.


 2. Everybody run a IPX driver, if playing under real DOS. Else, everybody
    play under Win95 (create a shortcut to DOOMATIC on your desktop, this
    will leave more memory to the program instead of using the DOS box).


 3. Everybody run DOOMATIC.


 4. In the WADLIST (window to the left), you will see WADSETS, which are
    the levels you can play.

    Press ENTER on 'hipafrag'. You have created a server!

    Everybody else (up to 4 players) press 'J' to join a server, and
    choose the newly created server (only when they see it on the right
    window).


 5. When the master sees that everybody has joined, he presses 'S' to start
    the game!

    If you have chosen 'HIPAFRAG', the 'hipafrag.wad' will be automatically
    copied over the IPX network to the other players! Cool uh?!


 Now changing the basic options like TIMER , TURBO and such is very easy:
 the keyboard shortcuts are enclosed in brackets, and displayed in diffe-
 rent colors. Just press the associated key, or click on the option.

 You might want to look at the 'QUICK OVERVIEW' section to understand the
 difference between 'Game options' and 'Wadset defaults'.


 QUICK SETUP
 ***********

 1. Enter your name by clicking on the '[N]ame' box or press 'N' key.

    Your name will be recorded into demos, and it will identify yourself
    when you create/join a server.


 2. Select your preferred player color by clicking on 'Co[l]or' or use
    'L' key.

    If multiple players chooses the same preferred color, the first to
    join will receive their color, the later to join will get the remaining
    colors.

    This means of course that the server will ALWAYS have his favorite
    color!


 3. DO NOT change the '[C]onfig' option, unless you use a particular
    configuration file for Doom which is not 'default.cfg'.

    See 'TIPS' section to know more about how '[C]onfig' can be useful.


 QUICK OVERVIEW
 **************


 Let's have a look at the windows:


 'Wadset'	 : the main vertical window to the left. This is where you
		   choose a level and optional patch to play.

		   Press ENTER on a Wadset to create a server.

		   Press DELETE to delete a Wadset (after confirmation).

		   You can Duplicate, Rename, Create wadsets by using the
		   WADSET menu options (use right mouse button or ESCAPE).


 '[J]oin game'	 : in this window, you will see currently active Doomatic
		   servers.

		   If a server is already started, you will see 'playing'
		   next to it. You can't join a game when it's already
		   started.

		   Press 'J' to join a server (if you see one!).


 'Game options'  : the main game options. These are general options that
		   are active whatever WADSET you choose.

		   The game options are:

		   'Record [d]emo' : activate it if you want to record demos
				     (LMP files).
		   'T[u]rbo'	   : turbo value, enter 0 to disable it.
		   '[T]imer'	   : timer value, enter 0 to disable timer.


 'Wadset defaults': each WADSET has its own associated settings.

		    THIS IS A REALLY NICE FEATURE!

		    It means that you will always have the right options
		    for each map.

		    Eg: you can have 'XXX.WAD' which is at MAP02 and is
			better using 'Old deathmatch', and No monsters.

			you can have 'YYY.WAD' which is at MAP05, plays
			at skill level 3, with monsters.

		    To set the options for a particular Wadset:

		     1. highlight the Wadset into the WAdset list using
			cursor [Up] and [Down] keys (don't press Enter!)

		     2. the options for the currently highlighted wadset
			are displayed in the 'WAdset default' window.

		     3. the WAD files are displayed in the '[W]AD list'
			window at the bottom of the screen.

		    All the settings are saved when you quit DOOMATIC, so
		    be careful.


 QUICK TEST WADSET
 *****************

 The 'Quick test WadSet' allow you to quickly test new levels without having
 to create a WadSet for it.

     - enter the 'WadDir' mode by pressing TAB key. Check the 'WadDir' title
       at the top of the left window.
     - the WadDir window displays the current directory and the wad files.
       Browse through your dirs until and locate a wad file that you'd like
       to play.
     - set the right options in the 'Quick test WadSet' window (map number,
       skill, ...).
     - if you want to play only this wad file, check that the 'Wad list'
       window is empty, and press ENTER on the wad file.
       if you want to use more than one wad file, use the SPACEBAR key to
       add each wad file to the 'Wad list' window. Once it is done, press
       the ENTER key.
     - by pressing the ENTER key, you have created a server, you will be
       asked a name for it: people who join your game will see it in the
       Servers window.
     - wait for other players to join, and use 'S' key as usual to Start
       the game!


 HOW TO CREATE A WADSET
 **********************

 In the future we will add an 'automatic Wadset creation' which scans for
 your wad files and creates a Wadset for each one... but for now, you'll
 have to setup them more or less by hand . Let's see how!

 PLEASE NOTE!

 *   You create WadSets only for the levels that you like to play often,
     so that you can launch them in a breeze.

 *   You don't need to create a Wadset when you want to quickly test
     wad files, use the 'WadDir' mode for this (press 'TAB').

 *   Only ONE person (the 'master') need to define WadSets!
     Everybody who join your game will receive the WadSet, but it is not
     recorded into their WadSet list (it's just temporary).

 WadSets are very useful for compilations wads like 'DwangoX.wad'. Because
 you have to remember which cool map you liked is at which map number...
  with WadSets you can give a description for each cool map that you liked
 into a Wad compilation, and simply launch each map by looking at its
 description in the WadSet list.


 There is 3 ways to create a Wadset (long to read, quick to do) :

 1. EASY CREATE A WADSET FROM 'WADDIR' MODE :

    This mode is useful when you don't know exactly the name of your wads:

	- press 'TAB' if you're not in WadDir mode (look at the top of the
	  left window).
	- Now you can browse through your directories using the mouse or
	  keyboard (ENTER, CURSOR UP / DOWN).
	- Press SPACE to add a WAD file to the Wad list (bottom window).
	- Press SPACE again to remove a WAD file from the Wad list, or
	  edit the Wad list (click on it, use 'W' key).
	- choose the settings in the 'Quick test Wadset', like Map number,
	  skill...
	- Pressing 'ENTER' will create a server, like in WadSet mode.
	- Enter a description that everybody will see when joining your
	  game.

    Now, suppose you liked that map, and you want to keep it into your
    WadSet list :

	Press 'INSERT' to add the 'Quick test WadSet' to the WadSet list.

    The 'Quick test WadSet' is simply a temporary WadSet for launching
    games without having to add it to your WadSet list.


 2. CREATE A WADSET IN 'WADSET' MODE :

	- Choose 'Create Wadset' from the WadSet menu, or use 'INSERT' key.
	- Enter a description for your Wadset (eg: 'Cool level with stairs')
	- Your new Wadset is now highlighted in the Wadset list to the left.
	  Because it is highlighted, you can change the settings for it:
	  click on the different options in the 'Wadset defaults' window or
	  use the bracketed keys.
	- Enter the name of the external WAD files in the 'Wad list' window.


    VERY NICE FEATURE !

       Please note that since DOOMATIC does a RECURSIVE SEARCH of the files,
      you don't need to type the paths to the external wad files : just type
      the filename (with .WAD extension).



 3. CREATE A WADSET FROM AN EXISTING ONE :

    This is useful for wad compilations, when you just have to change the
    map number, you can duplicate a WadSet to keep the same settings and
    wad list :

	- Highlight a WadSet that you want to duplicate.
	- Choose 'Duplicate' from the WadSet menu.
	- Enter a description for the new Wadset.


 USING THE MOUSE
 ***************

 If like me you like to click-click-click ... here's the tips.

 *   Most options displayed on the screen can be clicked on. The mouse
     cursor will disappear and the text cursor will appear when you have
     to enter values with the keyboard. You can always use the ESCAPE key
     to exit keyboard-edition.

 *   Click once on a WadSet to select it.

 *   Double-click on a WadSet to create a server (start a game).

 *   Click on the upper-left corner of the screen to quit Doomatic.

 *   Click on the [ Up ] and [Down] buttons on the WadDir or WadSet list
     to move one line up or down. You can keep the button pressed to
     continue to move.

 *   The menu works like Amiga menus : you have to keep the right mouse
     button pressed while navigating through the menu options. To select
     a menu option, just release the right mouse button when the menu
     option is highlighted. If that annoys you, you can use the ESCAPE
     key to bring the menu.

 *   Clicking the left mouse button in the 'Wad list' box, will enter the
     Wad list edition just where you have clicked.

 TIPS
 ****

 *   DOOMATIC always do a RECURSIVE SEARCH of the files (EXE and WADs)
     this means you don't need to type the path for the wad names in the
     Wad list of each WadSet.

     The RECURSIVE SEARCH starts at the base directory of Doom2 (where
     Doom2.exe and Doom2.wad is located), and then browse through all
     subdirectories. It will NOT search on other drives, neither in
     PARENT directories of Doom2 dir (this would take too much time!).

     This means also that everybody can organize its directories and wad
     files as he/she wishes. Eg: Player A can have COOL.WAD in 'wads' dir
     and Player B can have it into a 'coolmaps' dir.

     This is a really nice feature because DOOMATIC won't make multiple
     copies of the same wad files when copying the files through network.

     Even the EXE patches can be moved into subdirectories, since they are
     executed from Doom2 base dir. it will work!


 *   About the '[C]onfig' option : sometimes you let someone play on your
     machine but he/she doesn't have the same options... so you run Doom
     SETUP, change the controls, play, run SETUP again, and so on...

     Now the nightmare is finished:

     Run 'SETUP -config yourname.CFG' for each player who plays on your
     machine. Eg: SETUP -config fab.CFG, SETUP -config boris.CFG.

     You'll have different .CFG files, now in Doomatic, when somebody else
     play on your machine, he/she just enter his name into the '[C]onfig'
     option (the name used when calling SETUP).

     DOOMATIC will warn you when you enter the '[C]onfig' option, if it
     doesn't find the config file.


 *   When you have defined lots of WADSETS, remember to do a backup of the
     doomatic.cfg file from time to time.


 *   DOOMATIC configuration file 'doomatic.cfg' is a text-file, so you
     can edit it by hand if you wish.


 *   If you are developing levels for Doom, you can create a batch file that
     add some lines to the doomatic.cfg file. This way you can automatically
     add a WADSET for your level with the right settings, to the user's
     Wadset list.

     Example:

	Here's a sample of your 'level install' :
	(I'm not sure whether pure DOS 'ECHO' can echo at the end of a file
	 that's why I use copy)

	---------------------------< cut here >-------------------------------
	copy doomatic.cfg dtic.cfg >NUL
	copy /A mylevel.cfg + dtic.cfg doomatic.cfg >NUL
	del dtic.cfg >NUL
	----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Here's what your 'level.cfg' could look like :

	---------------------------< cut here >-------------------------------
	// <- use this for comment
	#WADSET
	desc = "My very cool level!"
	gametype = 1		  // Old deathmatch
	wads = "hipafrag.Wad"
	----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *   You can change the 'maxdemo' setting by editing the doomatic.cfg file.
     (default is 2048).


 *   When editing wadnames into the 'Wad list' window (bottom of screen),
     you can use CURSOR UP / DOWN keys to move to the previous / next wad.


 DOOMATIC FEATURES
 *****************

    Client/Server model …-la-Quake :
	one person chooses the level and options, everybody else
	simply joins the game!

    Multiple Servers :
	if more than 4 persons are using Doomatic, you may see
	multiple Servers, and join the one of your choice. You
	can even see games that already started, so you know when
	people are playing Doom over the network !

    Automatic file transfer if file is missing :
	when the Server starts the game, everyone who is missing
	files will receive them via network. You will receive the
	files in a sub directory of Doom called 'DOWNLOAD'.

    Recursive search of the files :
	put your wad files wherever you want, DOOMATIC will
	search for them before copying. So you will never have
	two copies of the same file in separate directories.

    WADSET collection :
	a WADSET is a grouping of levels, patches, and game options
	like 'nomonsters, skill, map #' that are appropriate for the
	level. Once you have setup a WADSET for your preferred
	levels, you will never enter the options again, you just
	press 'Enter' on a WADSET, and the game is launched !

    Automatic WADSET creation :
	choose the wad files into a directory, enter a description
	for your wadset and Doomatic adds the Wadset to your Wadset list.

    Edit - Rename - Delete - Duplicate Wadsets :
	each Wadset has its own description , so you can find easily
	your preferred levels !

    Usage sort :
	your WADSETs can be sorted in order of usage! The ones at
	the top of the list are the ones that you have played the most !

    Enter your Name :
	when you join a game, everybody else see your name, and
	the names will be recorded into your demos !

    Choose your Config : if you let
	someone play on your machine, no need to setup the config
	again and again, each player can have its own config.

    Choose your preferred Color :
	the first players to join a game will receive their chosen
	color, the later to join will receive the remaining
	colors.

    Support for EXE patches :
	with each WADSET you can associate an EXE patch. A 'patch'
	Wadset can be activated on the top of another Wadset. You
	select the patch Wadset by pressing 'Space' on it, then
	you press 'Enter' on any other Wadset to launch the game.

    Wad manager :
	you can rename and delete files from DOOMATIC.

    Nice text-mode interface :
	with menu and mouse. You can use the keyboard if you like so.

    Clean code, runs under Win95 :
	provided you have enough memory, DOOMATIC can run in a DOS
	box and will run perfectly! (You should have at least
	16mb to run Doom2 under Win95).

    and lot of more!
	(in Boris's own words)




 USING EXE PATCHES WITH DOOMATIC ( USING TWO WADSETS AT THE SAME TIME )
 ********************************--------------------------------------

 Quick n dirty info :l


    Just create a Wadset with a name like 'my cool patch',
    then enter the name of the patched Doom2 EXE, WITHOUT .EXE extension,
    in the 'E[x]e' option of the 'WadSet defaults' window.

    Type in the external wad files that are needed by the patch into
    the Wad list (bottom window). Eg: 'gfx.wad snd.wad'.

    Now you can activate the patch on top of any other cool map you'd like
    to play by pressing SPACEBAR on the patch WadSet. You'll see a '*'
    before it, which indicates that this patch is currently active.

    Press ENTER on any other WadSet to play it with the patch.

    Press SPACEBAR again on the patch WadSet if you want to de-activate it.

    You can only activate ONE patch WadSet at a time.

    IMPORTANT :

     - when you activate a patch WadSet, if you have entered an EXE with it,
       the EXE of the patch WadSet will be used in place of the one that
       maybe defined in the other 'level' WadSet.

     - the wad files of the patch WadSet are activated AFTER the ones of the
       'level' WadSet. This is to ensure that resources needed by the patch
       will not be replaced by resources defined in the wad files of the
       'level' WadSet.

     - Other settings like skill, map number, and such doesn't matter for
       a patch WadSet, the settings of the 'level' WadSet will be used.

 We'd like to add TCP/IP support and/or modem support in the future...

 But you should understand that by doing such a util for Doom today in
 the end of 1997, we'd like to receive some feedback !
